# Es2015 Modules

Since es2015 modules are not yet supported in node or the browser, we must use a special build system in order to make them work in our environment.

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies, and then, you cannot run the code by doing just `node C.js`.  Instead you must run your code by running `npm start` which first transpiles the code.
