# Big O Analysis

Express the running times of the following algorithms in Big O notation. Justify your responses.

Some of these are just review. A few apply Big O to algorithms we saw before.

Assume the _worst case_ running time—i.e., consider only the _maximum_ number of instructions the algorithm could take.

What is the running time of...

* Selection sort? 
o(n^2)
* Insertion sort?
0(n^2)
* Linear search?
0^n
* Binary search?
0(log^n)
* Finding duplicates in an array?
o(n^2)
### BONUSES

If you're mathematically inclined, you might find these interesting. If not, feel free to take a stab anyway, but don't worry too much about proving your solution.

What is the running time for an algorithm that—

* Finds all triplets `(x, y, z)` such that `x + y + z = sum`, where `sum` is specified by the user?


  * E.g.: `threeSum(list, sum)` will find all possible triplets of numbers in `list` that sum to `sum`.

* Same question, but for doubles?

  * In general, what is the running time for finding n-tuples in `list` that sum to `sum`?
