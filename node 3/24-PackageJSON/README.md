# Weather Dest

## File

* [`index.js`](index.js)

## Instructions


## NPM Init/Install

* Navigate to the root of your project folder

* Then do the following:

  * Create a `package.json` file (i.e. run `npm init`)

  * Add your dependencies to the `package.json` (i.e. run `npm install node-geocoder` and `npm install weather-js`)

  * Add your EsLint dev dependencies (run `npm install --save-dev eslint` and `npm install --save-dev eslint-config-google`)

  * Confirm that you now have a `node_modules` folder with the `node-geocoder` and `weather-js` packages as a result

  * Finally, re-run your `index.js` to confirm that it still works as expected

* Now delete your `node_modules` folder again but keep your `packages.json` file. This time...

  * Simply run `npm install` or `npm i`

  * Confirm that you once again have a `node_modules` folder with your packages listed as dependencies

  * Finally, re-run `index.js` to confirm that it still works as expected
